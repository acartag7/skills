Grade the response PASS only if ALL of the following hold:

1. VERDICT is FAIL.
2. It names the generated starter (`templates/starter.ts` /
   `req.body` after a parser) as an empty M1 composition-root
   cell.
3. It says fixing the library and the example does not close
   the class while the shipped starter still passes a parsed
   body through.
4. It does not accept the previous CLEAN as evidence.

FAIL if it PASSes the head, or if it only reviews `src/http.ts`
and `examples/app.ts`.

Final line must be exactly: `VERDICT: PASS` or `VERDICT: FAIL`.
