A previous local reviewer returned CLEAN. The implementer says
the store failure is now a generic 500 and no longer leaks the
driver message.

Exact head:

```text
// src/revoke.ts
export function revoke(store: { destroy(id: string): void }, id: string) {
  try {
    store.destroy(id);
  } catch {
    throw new Error("operation failed");
  }
}

// docs/contract.md (unchanged on this head)
// "revoke always returns HTTP 200. Store errors are swallowed
//  and the caller is told the token is gone."
```
